                <p>Hi my name is Mohamed I was born on August 24<sup>th</sup></p> 
                <p> Im a simple guy that enjoys making art. I have loved art since I was a kid</p>
                <p> As a kid I would constantly draw characters characters like Sonic the Hedgehog or Pok√©mon characters for fun </p>
                <p>I specifically like to make <abbr title= "Digital Art">DA</abbr>.</p>
                <P>As a result of my passion for art, I studied at an art program here at Algonquin!</P>
                <p>The reason I took this program was to gain new skills I could put towards my art career.</p>
                <p>I would like to build my own website rather than rely on those rough website builders</p>
                <p>Learning some graphic and web design skills could be useful <em>I look forward to seeing where the future takes me.</em> </p>
